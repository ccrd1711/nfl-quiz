# Quickfire NFL Quiz website

![The Quickfire Divisional NFL quiz](/assets/images/validation/amiresponsive-nfl.png)

Having understood that JavaScript was going to be all about introducing interactivity to my site, I very quickly had the idea to make a quiz, and to have it based around something I love. I've got an interest in multiple different sports and as I was watching the end of the NFL regular season and playoffs around the time of doing my lessons, I thought it would be cool to create a quiz based on that.

# Introduction 

## A Brief Summary 

- This quiz is designed for those who follow the National Football League (NFL) and want to test their divisional knowledge, or perhaps enhance their knowledge. 

- The NFL consists of 8 divisions across 2 conferences. The AFC and NFC are the different conferences, and the divisions in each are named North, South, East and West (e.g. AFC South, NFC East). Each division has 4 teams, which makes up the total 32 teams across the current league. 

- 'Analytical' quizzes/games such as these ones are commonplace for NFL fans, and can be a source of pride for a fan when competing with friends etc. Here in Wales I have a group of friends who follow it along with me, and we have had similar games/quizzes in person before. Once we did a speed game to see who could name every team in the NFL the fastest from memory. Moments like that have helped inspire me during this project, as well as knowing I had a dedicated and trustworthy fan base to test the website close to completion. 

## Deployment and Accessing Code Workspace 

* This website was deployed using GitHub Pages - [The Quickfire NFL Divisional Quiz](https://github.com/ccrd1711/nfl-quiz)

* [Go to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ccrd1711/nfl-quiz) and click on 'Deployments' on the right hand side, then click the site URL which is placed under the last deployment timestamp.

* To fork the repository, go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ccrd1711/nfl-quiz) and click the Fork button in the top right corner. 

## My Own Deployment

* I deployed my site early in the development process as I was aware from the course teaching that the preview site doesn't give a true reflection of the finished project, or at least it's liable to errors or displaying differently.

* Between project one and project two, we transitioned from Gitpod (a cloud-based development environment) to VS Code for local development. As part of this shift, I first ensured that my git commands were still logging correctly to the repository on GitHub, which they were. I tested this first on my first project, the Aberystwyth Beach Cleanup website. 

* To deploy my site initially, here were the steps taken:

   I went to [my repository homepage](https://github.com/ccrd1711/aber-cleanup).

   I clicked on 'Settings' along the top toolbar within the page, then I clicked on 'Pages'.

   In 'Branch', I clicked the dropdown and changed it from 'None' to 'Main'. In the new box that appeared I ensured that the folder was set to '/(root)', and then I pressed 'Save'.

   I then pressed '<> Code' in the top left to bring me back to the repo homepage and waited for 2-3 minutes while the site deployed.

   I refreshed the page. If the site has deployed properly, a section appears called 'Deployments' down the right hand side (referenced above under 'Deployment and Accessing Code Workspace'). Within this section I seen my deployed site's URL. 

   Note: It was in here I could obtain the link to the site to also share with friends and family for testing at various stages along the project.

### Design development 

### The background image 

- The background image of this project has changed multiple times. First it started with a gradient leading from a black nav bar to a blue footer. It looked great but it didn't really hit home the theme of the quiz for me. I then found a similarly styled background (in terms of colour) that had the NFL logo in it in the middle surrounded by floodlights. This looked brilliant however due to copyright worries I decided against continuing with that backdrop. (This is also similar to the issue I had with the home button - now just a football - which was also the logo in black and white). Instead I found the image you see now of a California football stadium on Unsplash, which has free to use images.

# Credits 

## Code Inspiration 

* When I decided to build a quiz I went to [YouTube](https.//youtube.com) and found [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9AaCfk0qh8&t=0s) of videos by [Live Blogger](https://www.youtube.com/@LiveBlogger) which really gave me some good foundational tips in how to begin this website. No code was taken directly from this video series but I watched a few of them numerous times because his approach and style to creating the site made it look so easy and stylish. 

## Content 

* This quiz is an original creation and all questions are based on my personal knowledge of the NFL. No copyrighted or external sources were used to complile the quiz content.

* All NFL team names, logo, and division names are the property of the **National Football League (NFL)** and their respective owners. This project is an **unofficial fan-made quiz** and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the NFL or any of its teams. 

## Media 

* [This](https://ar.inspiredpencil.com/pictures-2023/black-and-white-american-football) is the site where I sourced the image used for the home button in the top left of the quiz and registration pages. [Direct link here](https://artpictures.club/autumn-2023.html) to just that image.

* [Here](https://unsplash.com) is the site where I sourced the image used for the background on the landing/quiz page. [Direct link here](https://unsplash.com/photos/football-field-GB9XKDZWwp0) to just that image uploaded by user [Patrick Ogilvie](https://unsplash.com/@patrickogilvie). 

## Acknowledgements 

* I would like to thank my mentor Rory Patrick Sheridan for his guidance during the middle and end of this project, in particular highlighting an error thrown by my JavaScript that I wouldn't have found without him spamming the quiz answers! 

* I would like to thank my fiancee, friends and family who tested this site for me on a few different devices. Particularly the group of friends here in Aberystwyth, one of whom mentioned that one of my teams had an old name tagged to them (The Washington Commanders, once the Washington Football Team).
